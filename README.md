## How to use

Use your extension or nsec bunker to login and get started. 
You must set your relays or it will post to my one default test relay. 
Relays are stored in the local storage of your browser. If you purge your local storage, your relays will be cleared.

Once your relays are setup, you can post to them on the main page and see your content in preview mode before sending it to the relays.

That's it! 

Super simple. No Extras.
